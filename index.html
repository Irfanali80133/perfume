        <h1 >About Us</h1>
        <p style="font-style: normal;">The third entry on the list of the world's most expensive perfumes is the Shumukh perfume, created right here in the UAE. 'Shumukh' is an Arabic word, meaning 'deserving the highest'. The inventors of the perfume are called 'Creators of Spirit' and are under the luxury fragrance brand Nabeel. Costing an eye-watering US$1.3 million for a 3-litre bottle, the perfume arrives in an  Italian Murano crystal bottle, adorned with a gold falcon, Arabian horses, roses and a globe to represent the spirit of Dubai. The entire bottle contains 3,571 diamonds (38.55 carats in total), big pearls, 2.5 kg of 18-K gold, and 5.9 kgs of pure silver. The bottle itself stands two metres tall and sits on a cushioned leather stand also nearly two meters tall - leading it to win two Guinness World Records - one for most diamonds set in a perfume bottle and the second for it being tallest commercially available remote-controlled fragrance spray bottle. The perfume has notes of sandalwood, musk, ylang-ylang, Turkish rose, Indian agar wood, musk and patchouli.</p>
